The approach used is based on the CRFill Model, which can be found [here](https://github.com/zengxianyu/crfill).
## Usage
To use the model, we need to simply call process.py in the docker environment (the container must supply the /input and /output folders), following exactly the Node21 setup.
All the code for running it (including a trained model) is contained in the `model_submission` folder.

The complete code setup can be found in the `crfill` folder, in which there is also an example script of how it was trained.
